## Clover Merchants -- by type of business
  * **Accounting**: Merchants process payroll weekly or bi-weekly, pay quarterly taxes, and ensure that expenses are balanced. A business owner may do this herself, or work with a bookkeeper or accountant.
  * **Inventory Management**: Merchants must add new and seasonal items to inventory, update prices, keep track of what’s in stock, be notified of items to be ordered, and easy re-ordering of stock items.
  * **Menu**: Restaurant owners create and update their menus, add seasonal appetizers and entrees, and set prices for regular items and specials.
  * **Sales**: Merchants and their employees spend time with customers to find out what they like and need. Merchants must also attract new customers and repeat customers more frequently with discounts and specials to increase sales.
  * **Social Media**: An important marketing tool for merchants is social media. Therefore, many merchants post regularly to Facebook, Twitter, and other social media about specials, events, and other news. They also respond to Yelp reviews and Foursquare check-ins.
  * **Employee Management**: One of the most important activities for business owners is to recruit, hire, and train new employees, in addition to tracking employee performance.
  * **Cash Flow**: Merchants monitor their cash flow so they can pay vendors and follow up on accounts receivable.
  * **Customer Service**: Providing good customer service is a top priority. This includes recognizing and rewarding loyal customers, and handling special orders and requests.
  * **Marketing**: Merchants get the word out about their business via advertising and social media. In addition, business owners network and interact with the local community.
