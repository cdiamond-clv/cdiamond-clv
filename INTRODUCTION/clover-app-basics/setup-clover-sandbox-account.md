The Clover open platform provides tools for you to design and build solutions for Clover merchants.

The Clover sandbox environment is a testbed where you can experiment with the platform capabilities. You can create test merchant accounts to manage merchant data and also to install and test your solutions for these test accounts. You can also create test merchants in other regions where you want to make your app available.

#Sample inventory
Weâ€™ve created a <a href="https://clover.box.com/s/y08he8u7llov7shufskgyb5stlgcs6s8" target="_blank">sample inventory file</a> that will help you get started with your test merchant.

After you log on to your sandbox account, select your test merchant from the drop-down list in the header. Select the Inventory app and then import the sample inventory file.


#Clover platform status updates
Sign up on Clover's Status page, https://status.clover.com/, to stay informed about maintenance windows. Using this information you can plan your work so that you don't attempt to connect to Clover's resources when they will be less responsive than usual or down for maintenance.

The URLs for all sandbox services now have dynamic IP addresses. Any developers using static IP addresses for connecting to sandbox services must support the URLs instead.
