* Using the [Clover Android SDK](https://github.com/clover/clover-android-sdk), you can build Android apps that run Clover devices. Your apps can leverage rich business data and Clover device hardware capabilities.

* Using the [Clover REST API](ref:api-reference-overview), you can build web apps. To build web apps on the Clover platform, make authorized Clover REST API calls and help merchants manage their business better.

* Using the [Ecommerce API](ref:charges), you can build apps that integrate with ecommerce services in various ways to tailor to the needs of merchants.

Your apps are published on the [Clover App Market](https://www.clover.com/appmarket).

The Clover platform also enables you to [integrate your own POS](doc:clover-development-basics-semi) with Clover devices and accept PCI compliant dip, swipe, and tap payments.
