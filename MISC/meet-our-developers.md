> "We are very excited about the opportunity to work with Clover and feel that the Clover POS is leading the way for restaurant operators to efficiently update and integrate their front-of-house and back-of-house operations. Their extensive sales channels are also bringing these advanced features to a wider range of merchants...It is really nice to be working with such a developer-oriented company and have seen exceptional results in terms of new sign ups."

> "Clover not only provides robust developer tools, but the company is committed to the commercial success of its app developers.  Clover has provided phenomenal access to the First Data sales channels and, more importantly, has invested to ensure those sales channels can successfully pair buyer with seller."

> "With the strength and experience of the First Data sales team, we've been able to collect valuable feedback early on. Every second First Data processes 2,000 transactions across its global network. That's a lot of swipes and clicks. Heck yes we're excited to grow alongside Clover!"
